# Usage:
#
# Uncomment and modify variables definitions below to override default
# values set for Ubuntu. Unsure that paths and names define existing
# directories and files, and that hash value is correct.
# As this file is sourced in the sbsm_sign_modules shell script, it is
# possible to use variables defined prior its inclusion (for example the
# ones defining the kernel version. See example about signing tool
# below.
#
# Actual default values are:
#   SBSM_PRIVKEY=/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv
#   SBSM_CERTIFICATE=/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
#   SBSM_SIGN_BIN=/usr/bin/kmodsign
#   SBSM_SIGN_HASH=sha512
#
# It is not necessary to redefine them, unless they have been modified,
# or the distribution in use is not Ubuntu.
#

# Path and file name to the private key.
#
#SBSM_PRIVKEY=/path_to/key.priv

# Path and file name to the certificate.
#
#SBSM_CERTIFICATE=/path_to/certificate.der

# Path and file name to the signing tool. Some distributions provide one
# signing tool per kernel located in kernels directories. It is possible
# to use defined variables from the sbsm_sign_modules shell script to
# locate the signing tool. For example, in case of Fedora, one can use
# this definition:
# SBSM_SIGN_BIN=/usr/src/kernels/${KERNEL_VERSION}/scripts/sign-file
#
#SBSM_SIGN_BIN=/path_to/signing_tool

# Value of the chosen hash algorithm.
# Possible values are: sha1 sha224 sha256 sha384 sha512
#
#SBSM_SIGN_HASH=sha512
